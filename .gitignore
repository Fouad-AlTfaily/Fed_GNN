# Local Data (keep directory structure but not large files if needed, though user might want data committed. 
# For now, let's ignore the generated data if it's large, but user seems to want to commit it? 
# The user committed 'preprocess_data.py' but deleted 'data/preprocessing/prepare_dataset.py'.
# Usually we ignore 'data/' but keep 'data/.gitkeep'. 
# Given the user instructions, I'll stick to standard python ignores.)
